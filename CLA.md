# Contributor License Agreement for LLMing-Lodge

## Purpose

LLMing-Lodge uses a dual licensing model (BSL 1.1 + commercial licenses).
To preserve the ability to offer commercial licenses alongside the public
BSL license, all contributors must sign this Contributor License Agreement
(CLA) before their contributions can be accepted.

## Agreement

By submitting a contribution (pull request, patch, or other code change) to
the LLMing-Lodge project, you agree to the following terms:

### 1. Definitions

- **"You"** means the individual or legal entity submitting the Contribution.
- **"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including
  modifications or additions to the Licensed Work, that you intentionally
  submit to the project.
- **"Project"** means the LLMing-Lodge software project maintained by
  Michael Ikemann.

### 2. Grant of Copyright License

You hereby grant to Michael Ikemann a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
distribute your Contributions and derivative works thereof.

### 3. Grant of Patent License

You hereby grant to Michael Ikemann a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use,
offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution, where
such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are
necessarily infringed by your Contribution alone or by combination of your
Contribution with the Project.

### 4. Representations

You represent that:

- You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses.
- Each Contribution is your original creation.
- Your Contribution does not violate any third party's intellectual property
  rights.
- If your employer has rights to intellectual property that you create, you
  have received permission to make the Contribution on behalf of that
  employer, or your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions.

### 5. Dual Licensing Acknowledgment

You acknowledge that:

- LLMing-Lodge is licensed under the BSL 1.1 publicly and may also be
  licensed under separate commercial terms.
- Your Contribution may be distributed under both the BSL 1.1 and any
  commercial license offered by the Licensor.
- The Licensor retains the right to relicense the project (including your
  Contributions) under different terms in the future.

### 6. No Obligation

You understand that the decision to include your Contribution in the Project
is entirely at the discretion of the project maintainer. This agreement does
not create any obligation to use or incorporate your Contribution.
